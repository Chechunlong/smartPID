the code is complied with arduino IDE 1.6.13 and SAMD core 32 BIT ARM Cortex M0+ version 1.6.11
notice that the binary code produced should be loaded with the smartPID MSD bootloader and is not compatible witn SAM-BA bootloader

it's needed to instal smarPID board definitio, please see "driver" section

Test area:

MCU test 

EEPROM (read e write)

OLED (graphic and text)

tactile switch

buzzer

wifi module (serial connection and FW version)

temperature read (NTC and DS18B20 on both port)

oututput activation (SSR/relay/12V DC)
