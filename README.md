Professionally engineered, SmartPID Controller is a high-tech product that facilitates temperature and process control: heating or cooling. 
Compared to your basic on/off thermostat, SmartPID is a piece of futuristic wonder.  

Compared to simple on/off thermostat SmartPID controller can collect temperature from multiple sensors, apply a custom and programmable control logic and drive different load (heater, cooler, valve, fan) with PID precision algorithm
You can easily replace your thermostat and add full process control to your application, data log and remote management

SmartPID Controller can control any thermo regulated process (heating or cooling) and any applications locally or remotely
It is flexible and very powerful device which can be programmed and adapted to any custom application

SmartPID Controller is 100 compatible with Arduino ecosystem


SmartPID Controller is a must device for Do-It- Yourself Enthusiasts, Software geeks, Makers, but also professionals that need affordable process controller

From homebrewing or wine making to aquarium or refolow oven temperature control SmartPID can add precision, power, flexibility programmability

In one word make your temperature process control SMART

All applications benefit from a full set of common features that are the baseline to developing smart applications.

SmartPID is a masterpiece of engineering. We have done our best to incorporate a ton of advanced features into a single compact box. Below you will find a table with all technical characteristic

SmartPID is powered by SAMD21 32-bit ARM® Cortex®-M0+ by Atmel

 SmartPID is 100% compatible with the Arduino echo system: you can plug in your PC via USB and program through the Arduino IDE.   

The key benefits of this design choice are

SAMD21 processor-based (like Zero or MKR1000)   
Dedicated USB bootloader and board definition   
Fully programmable via Arduino IDE   
Full set of support libraries available
smartPID has been designed by a maker for the maker community

smartPID IS IoT ready 

One of the unique smart features of the SmartPID Controller is its capability to store process log data and then make that data available either locally via USB interface or remotely via the cloud. 

You can easily access your data from the web on a desktop, smartphone, or tablet, which is perfect in case of critical situations that involve alarms and triggers. 

Plus, if your fridge goes into a block stage or your food dehydrator finishes its process, you can set up SmartPID to let you know.

SmartPID is connected to thingspeak

Among many different possible IoT solutions for SmartPID in this phase is the Thingspeak service. 

Thingspeak is based on a number of useful features that make it easy to use and integrate the SmartPID project.

-Real-time data collection and storage of process data generated by SmartPID    
-Simple and effective data visualization in both private and public channels  
-MATLAB® for data analysis and manipulation    
-Alerts and triggers for integration with other services    
-Scheduling    
-Open API

The relevant code is available on github, and in the future, a dedicated cloud service will be provided

SmartPID dedicated APP

We have developed a mobile app prototype for Android in order to retrieve data from the cloud server and in turn visualize that data on a smartphone.  

SmartPID pushes log data to a remote server so that the mobile app can retrieve it in a secure and encrypted way.

The smart app allows you to do the following:  

Login and authenticate user login on the server in order to access it in a secure way  
Display and visualize data via a dashboard so that the user can select a specific controller and data (filtered by date/time) and display the data in a graphic or tabular way  
Configure the device (this part is still under development)
You can configure all the unit parameters (HW set up, process parameter) via a web interface or mobile app and upload your configuration options on the device. Configuration options can then be stored on the server and used at any time. 

You can also set a temperature threshold and get notifications by local alarm, email, or Twitter.


developing application for both android and IOS and set up all the server infrastructure is complex and requires lot of investment, this is one of the part in scope od the crowdfunding campaing
