# smartPID
Professionally engineered, SmartPID Controller is a high-tech product that facilitates temperature and process control: heating or cooling. 
Compared to your basic on/off thermostat, SmartPID is a piece of futuristic wonder.  
SmartPID it is an ‚Äúopen platform‚Äù  that collects temperature from multiple sensors, apply programmable control logic, and drive different loads with precise PID  algorithm. SmartPID can be used to control any applications both locally and remotely via wifi and smartphone app

SmartPID Controller can control any thermo regulated process (heating or cooling) and any applications locally or remotely
It is flexible and very powerful device which can be programmed and adapted to any custom application

SmartPID Controller is 100 compatible with Arduino ecosystem

Compared to simple on/off thermostat SmartPID controller can collect temperature from multiple sensors, apply a custom and programmable control logic and drive different load (heater, cooler, valve, fanÖ) with PID precision algorithm
You can easily replace your thermostat and add full process control to your application, data log and remote management

SmartPID Controller is a must device for Do-It- Yourself Enthusiasts. Software geeks, Makers, but also professionals that need affordable process controller
From homebrewing or wine making to aquarium or refolow oven temperature control SmartPID can add precision, power, flexibility programmability
In one word make your temperature process control SMART
